// Flows will be imported for their side effects in this file.
// For React Native, these flows would typically be called via an API layer
// rather than directly imported and run on the client, especially if they
// require server-side resources or are computationally intensive.
// For this conversion, the files are kept, but their execution model changes.

// Example: import '../ai/flows/diagnose-plant-flow'; // if such a flow exists
